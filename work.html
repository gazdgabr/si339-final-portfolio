                Problem Statement: As the physical health of elderly folks begins to decline, their mental health often declines congruently. As such, improving the physical and mental health of the elderly may lead to improved length and quality of life.
                <br><br>
                I created Barbell Buddies to solve this problem. Many elderly people are not in the habit of going to the gym. Without this habit, exercising consistently is difficult, and motivation is necessary. With Barbell Buddies, elderly people can meet others in their area with similar exercise goals, and become accountability buddies, in order to better their physical health while making meaningful connections, thus bettering mental health.

                This was a cool little graphic design project that I worked on in Winter 2018. I researched the symbolic meaning of my favorite fruit, the peach.
                <br><br>
                In creating this, I showcased several design concepts. The Gestalt principles of continuity and closure are invoked by the letters, as they are partially hidden by the image, creating a 3D effect. The design also showcases random balance with dynamic movement (down the page towards the lower left corner).

                  During the second half of this class, students were assigned a series of presentations, followed by the writing of a case study and teaching note for use in Professor King’s undergraduate class, SI 310. I wrote my case on the Hawaii Missile Crisis, where I examined the role of Cold War nuclear systems, incidents, and accidents in contributing to the HMC. I argued that the HMC was not a normal accident, but had the systems in place been robust, the accident should have been
                  normalized. I also presented on the influence of culture on systems.

              I’m currently in the final year of my undergraduate at the University of Michigan School of Information, studying UX Design. When I graduate, I plan to go to chiropractic school for my doctorate.

              During most of the year, school is my life, but when I do have free time, I enjoy weightlifting, snowboarding, and rock climbing. I also love exploring Northern Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, especially during the summer!
